# Ripple Exchange - System Analysis and Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **API Routing Issues**
   - Fixed the duplicate `/api` path in URLs that was causing 502 errors
   - Properly configured the server to handle API requests with consistent paths
   - Added proper fallback route for client-side routing

2. **API Endpoint Fixes**
   - Fixed the `/api/admin/cached-deposits` endpoint that was returning a 500 error
   - Corrected data processing in the endpoint to handle deposits properly

3. **Deposit Monitoring System Fixes**
   - Implemented missing `processChainDeposits` function for EVM chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon)
   - Implemented missing `processSolanaDeposits` function for Solana chain
   - Added proper balance comparison and deposit recording logic

## System Analysis

### User Wallets
- Successfully retrieved wallet addresses for all users
- Checked wallet balances for user `dbhXePhEk8S7rVPbI8gcMQI4vRf2`
- Found a balance of 0.0038 BNB on BSC chain

### Transactions
- Found 8 transactions in the system:
  - 4 deposits (3 manual, 1 automatic)
  - 4 withdrawals (all completed)
- Most recent deposit was on March 9, 2025 (0.0028 BNB)

### Scripts Created
1. **check-deposits.js**
   - Retrieves all deposits from the Firestore database
   - Shows deposit details including user ID, amount, token, chain, and timestamp

2. **check-transactions.js**
   - Retrieves all transactions (deposits and withdrawals) from the database
   - Shows transaction details including status and processing notes

3. **check-wallet-balance.js**
   - Checks real-time blockchain balances for a specific user
   - Supports Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon chains

4. **start-ripple-exchange.sh**
   - Script to start both the server and frontend
   - Configures environment variables for production
   - Builds frontend if needed and starts the server on port 3000

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Server Configuration**
   - Use the fixed server.js file with proper API routing
   - Ensure the server is running on port 3000 for API requests (not 3001 as previously documented)

2. **Nginx Configuration**
   - Update Nginx configuration to route `/api/` requests to port 3000 instead of 3001
   - Keep the proper MIME type handling for static assets

3. **Monitoring**
   - Use the created scripts to monitor deposits and wallet balances
   - Check for any errors in the deposit monitoring process

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Ethereum RPC Connection**
   - The Ethereum RPC connection is failing with a "could not detect network" error
   - Consider using a different Infura endpoint or another provider

2. **Implement Proper Error Handling**
   - Add better error handling in the API endpoints
   - Provide more detailed error messages to help with debugging

3. **Optimize Deposit Caching**
   - Review the deposit caching mechanism for potential improvements
   - Consider adding pagination for large result sets
