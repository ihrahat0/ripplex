/* 
This is a placeholder for a QR code image file.
Since we can't upload binary files directly through this interface,
you'll need to replace this with an actual QR code image.

You can:
1. Create a QR code with any QR code generator (like qr-code-generator.com)
2. Save it as qr-code.png
3. Place it in the src/assets/images/layout/ directory
